# TheseEyes
Eyes Exercise from MIT Professional Coding Class

This Eyes exercise we submitted in class was reworked into "These Eyes" as it displays two eyes that follow your mouse moving across the screen. 

I frankly think it would be hilarious to embed the eyes into an picture of myself or someone I know to follow the mouse across the screen. It would look like some old school Scooby Doo stuff!
